### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
#### -To ensure my code is function and secure, I need to incorporate the intergration testing technique to verify the test coverage for every classes and methods of the code
### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
#### -To interpret user needs, every requierements should be written down into a checklist, then integrated into the code structure. For example, we Task.java and TaskService.java that require functions to check for condition whether it adhere with user's requirement or not. 
### How do I approach designing software?
#### -To approach designing software, I think we need to have a basic knowledge of one programming language, then check for documentaion throuroughly in order to understand user requriement. Also, we would want to be sufficient enough of using a testing technique such as Junit or Mockito so we can validate user's requirement checlist. After that, the process will become more easier, we can write a bit, then test a bit until the code structure is completed and the requirement is fullfilled
